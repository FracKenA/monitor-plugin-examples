# monitor-plugin-examples
Examples of Monitor compatible plugins.

No support will be given for these examples, and no support is implied. Everything here is for educational purposes only. The examples here are not fit for production use. They are, possibly, very shoddy and poorly implemented. Don't trust your life or job on this code. Do some research and implement a plugin which fits the target environment and its standards.

With that being said... Have fun with everything here, and happy hacking! :)
